According to some glottochronological speculations,[11][12] the Eastern Baltic
languages split from the Western Baltic ones between AD 400 and 600. The Greek


 geographer Ptolemy had already written of two Baltic tribe/nations by name,
 the Galindai and Sudinoi (Γαλίνδαι, Σουδινοί) in the 2nd century AD. The differentiation
  between Lithuanian and Latvian started after 800; for a long period, they could be


  considered dialects of a single language. At a minimum, transitional dialects existed


  until the 14th or 15th century and perhaps as late as the 17th century. Also, the
  13th- and 14th-century occupation of the western part of the Daugava basin (closely
  coinciding with the territory of modern Latvia) by the German Sword Brethren had a
   significant influence on the languages' independent development.

The earliest surviving written Lithuanian text is a translation dating
from about 1503–1525 of the Lord's Prayer, the Hail Mary, and the Nicene
Creed written in the Southern Aukštaitian dialect. Printed books existed
after 1547, but the level of literacy among Lithuanians was low through
the 18th century, and books were not commonly available. In 1864, following
the January Uprising, Mikhail Muravyov, the Russian Governor General of Lithuania,
banned the language in education and publishing and barred use of the Latin alphabet
altogether, although books printed in Lithuanian continued to be printed across the
border in East Prussia and in the United States. Brought into the country by book
smugglers despite the threat of stiff prison sentences, they helped fuel a growing
nationalist sentiment that finally led to the lifting of the ban in 1904.

Jonas Jablonskis (1860–1930) made significant contributions to the formation of
the standard Lithuanian language. The conventions of written Lithuanian had been
evolving during the 19th century, but Jablonskis, in the introduction to his
Lietuviškos kalbos gramatika, was the first to formulate and expound the
essential principles that were so indispensable to its later development.
His proposal for Standard Lithuanian was based on his native Western Aukštaitijan
dialect with some features of the eastern Prussian Lithuanians' dialect spoken in
 Lithuania Minor. These dialects[clarification needed] had preserved archaic phonetics
 mostly intact due to the influence of the neighbouring Old Prussian language, while
 the other dialects had experienced different phonetic shifts. Lithuanian has been the
 official language of Lithuania since 1918. During the Soviet era (see History of
 Lithuania), it was used in official discourse along with Russian, which, as the official
 language of the USSR, took precedence over Lithuanian.[13]
